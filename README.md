# GetMeOuttaHere

TODO:
Need a way to identify which cities we want to send people to based on criterion (or random if we're that lazy)
	-could use questions, distance from current city, etc. <--- might want to make a function on easily finding distance between two cities to make sure we're not sending someone super nearby.

Maybe look into ways we can incorporate/start using other apis from amadeus. For example, they have a rent a car api. could have a popup / bonus such as "want a car for when you arrive?" or, "need a place to stay while while you get on your feet?"

Need to look into how we're actually going to use the indeed search engine / call it. Something to think about. Apparently we can generate revenue if people actually click job listings through our website. Are we just going to have a listing of about 10-20 jobs and have a ranking system to decide which jobs we want to hand out?
